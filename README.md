# Career Services Application

## 1. Description
The objective of this project is to provide a career services platform where the students (people looking for jobs) will be able to post and update their portfolio and the employers should be able to post jobs. With the help of this, you can carry out a job head hunting in your own comfort. This benefits job-seeking candidates and employers to shortlist their potential job and employee respectively. This can also help employers find specific candidates as per their requirements along with job seekers being able to tailor their profile as per the market. All you require is a PC or a mobile device with Internet to access the website online. To get to this online career services system all the Students and Employers will create an account and use their email and password to login. Students will create/modify their profile and will view and apply to job postings. Employers will create and manage their job posts, review applications from candidates. The login credentials for this system are under high security and nobody will have the capacity to crack it easily. Employers will receive notifications when students apply to their job offers, and students when they are called for interview.

The following are the categories of main users:
1. Employer – create an account/register, login, browse candidates, add job offers, select candidates that have already applied to an offer for an interview, track the post
2. Student/Candidate – create an account/register, login, and build/upload a resume; browse and apply for job offers; track applications
3. Admin – Managing all user profiles, postings and tracking
