# Career Services Application

## 1. Description
The objective of this project is to provide a career services platform where the students (people looking for jobs) will be able to post and update their portfolio and the employers should be able to post jobs. With the help of this, you can carry out a job head hunting in your own comfort. This benefits job-seeking candidates and employers to shortlist their potential job and employee respectively. This can also help employers find specific candidates as per their requirements along with job seekers being able to tailor their profile as per the market. All you require is a PC or a mobile device with Internet to access the website online. To get to this online career services system all the Students and Employers will create an account and use their email and password to login. Students will create/modify their profile and will view and apply to job postings. Employers will create and manage their job posts, review applications from candidates. The login credentials for this system are under high security and nobody will have the capacity to crack it easily. Employers will receive notifications when students apply to their job offers, and students when they are called for interview.

The following are the categories of main users:
1. Employer – create an account/register, login, browse candidates, add job offers, select candidates that have already applied to an offer for an interview, track the post
2. Student/Candidate – create an account/register, login, and build/upload a resume; browse and apply for job offers; track applications
3. Admin – Managing all user profiles, postings and tracking

## 3. Project Approach & Technology
* Frontend - Angular <br>
We chose Angular for its ability to simplify the development process while providing high-performing and dynamic
web applications. Its intuitive and straightforward design makes it a great choice for our project. This versatility
allows us to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience.

* Backend - Springboot <br>
Spring Boot is a great fit due to its ability to expedite development within the short timeframe. It simplifies setup and configuration, allowing us to focus on building core features. We can easily integrate necessary functionalities such as user registration, login, job posting, and application tracking. Spring Boot's security features provide a solid foundation for protecting user data. Additionally, its scalability and performance optimizations ensure that your platform can handle a growing user base.

* Database - MongoDB <br>
By using MongoDB, we will benefit from its flexible data model, which allows
us to store and manage data in a way that makes sense for our specific use case. MongoDB also provides ease
of use, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to interact with the data. Additionally, MongoDB's 
compatibility with Spring Boot, allows for seamless integration with our application, improving overall efficiency
and performance.

* Documentation - GitHub Wiki <br>
We will use Github Wiki since it is easily accessible and conveniently located within your project repository hence allowing for seamless navigation and quick access to project documentation.
